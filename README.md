# Case-Study-Logistic-Regression
Objective:
Apply logistic regression for binary classification problems.

Steps:
Dataset: Example - Titanic survival data (titanic.csv).
Tasks:
Preprocess the data (handle missing values, one-hot encode categorical features).
Train a logistic regression model to classify survival.
Evaluate using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.
Plot a ROC curve.
Tools:
Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn.
Example Problem:
Predict whether a passenger survived based on features like age, gender, and ticket class.
